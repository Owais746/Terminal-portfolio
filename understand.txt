TERMINAL-PORTFOLIO: FULL CODE EXPLANATION (SIMPLE WORDS)

OVERVIEW
- This is a React app built with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
- It shows a fake “terminal” on the page. You type commands, it shows answers.
- Main logic: Terminal.jsx (the UI) + commandHandler.js (what each command does) + data files.

ENTRY FILES
1) index.html
- A very small HTML file.
- It has a <div id="root"></div> — React will render the app inside this div.
- It loads /src/main.jsx as a module script.

2) src/main.jsx
- Imports StrictMode, createRoot (React), global CSS (index.css), and the App component.
- createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(...) mounts <App /> into the page.
- <StrictMode> helps catch problems in development.

3) src/App.jsx
- Imports Terminal from ./components/Terminal.
- Function App returns <Terminal />. That’s the whole app.

STYLES
4) src/index.css
- Enables Tailwind layers: @tailwind base, components, utilities.
- Resets some basics (* { margin:0, padding:0, box-sizing: border-box }).
- Body uses monospace, black background, green text.
- Adds custom utility classes:
  - .text-glow: adds glow around text.
  - .terminal-glow: adds a green-ish box shadow.
  - @keyframes blink + .cursor-blink: blinking cursor effect.
  - @keyframes scanline + .scanline: moving scanline overlay.

5) src/App.css
- Default Vite template styles (logo spin, etc.). Likely not used in this project now.

CONFIG
6) eslint.config.js
- ESLint setup for JS/JSX, browser globals, React hooks lint rules, and React Refresh for Vite.
- Turns off old React JSX usage rules (since new JSX transform doesn’t need them).
- no-unused-vars is adjusted to ignore ALL_CAPS vars and underscore args.

7) postcss.config.js
- Uses Tailwind via '@tailwindcss/postcss' plugin.

8) tailwind.config.js
- Tells Tailwind to scan index.html and all files under src for class names.
- Extends theme with terminal colors:
  - terminal.bg, terminal.text (green), terminal.cyan, yellow, red, blue.
- Sets fontFamily.mono to ['Courier New','monospace'].

9) vite.config.js
- Standard Vite + React plugin config.

DATA AND UTILITIES
10) src/data/portfolioData.js
- Holds all “content” shown by commands.
- personalInfo: name, role, phone, email, city, links (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.).
- about: tagline and multiple paragraphs.
- skills: list of skills with a string level like "85%".
- projects: list of portfolio projects with title, description, url, tech list.
- services: list of services (title + description).
- experience: jobs with period, location, and bullet highlights.
- stats: simple counters (happyClients, completedProjects, hoursOfWork).

11) src/utils/stripHtml.js
- stripHtml(html):
  - Creates a temporary <div>, sets innerHTML = html, returns only the text (no tags).
- formatForDisplay(content): returns stripHtml(content).
- Purpose: When animating typing, we need plain text (no HTML tags), so we strip them first.

12) src/utils/commandHandler.js
- Exports processCommand(input).
- Steps inside processCommand:
  1) command = input.trim().toLowerCase()
  2) args = command.split(' ')
  3) mainCommand = args[0]
  4) switch(mainCommand) to decide what to do.
- For each command, returns an object: { type: string, content: string }
  - Terminal.jsx uses type to handle special behavior (e.g., clear/banner).
- Commands:
  - help: Shows available commands with short descriptions (as HTML string with Tailwind classes).
  - about: Prints personal info + about text. Uses data from personalInfo and about.
  - skills: Two modes:
      • With “--list”: shows a bar for each skill. It builds a bar using repeated block chars based on the percent value.
      • Without flag: simple bullet list with name and level.
  - projects:
      • With a number: shows detailed info of that one project (title, description, tech, and link).
      • Without number: shows all projects in a short list, with truncated descriptions and links.
  - experience: Prints work history with highlights.
  - services: Prints services list with titles and descriptions.
  - contact: Prints email, phone, location, WhatsApp link.
  - social: Prints links for GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Portfolio.
  - stats: Prints numbers from stats.
  - resume: Explains how to explore resume via commands and gives a download link (static path shown).
  - whoami: Returns "visitor@owais-portfolio" text.
  - date: Returns current date string from new Date().toString().
  - clear: Special — tells Terminal to clear history.
  - banner: Special — tells Terminal to show the ASCII banner again.
  - theme: Lists theme names (feature placeholder).
  - sudo: If the rest includes "rm -rf" → fun denial message; else error like real terminal.
  - hack: Another joke/easter egg block.
  - ls: Fake directory list string.
  - pwd: Fake path string.
  - echo: Returns whatever text comes after the command.
  - default (unknown): Red error message and a tip to run help.

MAIN UI COMPONENT
13) src/components/Terminal.jsx
- Imports React hooks, framer-motion, TypeAnimation, processCommand, personalInfo, and stripHtml.
- Small component TypingText({ text, speed=20, onComplete })
  - Purpose: show the output as if typed character-by-character.
  - useState displayedText starts as ''
  - useEffect sets an interval:
      • Every “speed” ms, grows the displayedText by one character until complete.
      • When done, clears interval and calls onComplete() if provided.
  - Renders a <div> with the current displayed text, keeping whitespace and wrapping long words.

- Main component Terminal()
  State:
  - history: array of past entries { command, output, type, isTyping? }.
  - commandHistory: list of all commands typed (for ArrowUp/Down navigation).
  - historyIndex: position in commandHistory when navigating (starts at -1 = not navigating).
  - currentInput: current text in the input field.
  - showWelcome: whether to show the ASCII banner + intro area.
  - inputRef: reference to the <input> element (to focus it).
  - outputRef: reference to the scrollable output container (to auto-scroll).
  - isBooting: shows boot messages for ~2 seconds.
  - isTyping: true while TypingText animation is running, false after it finishes.
  - showHelpModal: shows a small modal with instructions; closable.

  Effects:
  - On mount:
    • setTimeout after 2000ms: isBooting=false and showWelcome=true.
    • Focus the input if it exists.
  - When isTyping changes:
    • If not typing, and input is not focused, re-focus it (so typing is smooth).
  - When history or isTyping changes:
    • Auto-scroll to bottom: outputRef.scrollTop = outputRef.scrollHeight.
  - While isTyping is true:
    • Every 50ms, also auto-scroll (helps keep the newest typed text visible).

  Handlers:
  - handleCommand(e) → runs onKeyDown on the input.
    • If Enter:
      - Prevent default.
      - Read trimmed input. Ignore if empty or if isTyping (don’t allow new command during typing).
      - Push input into commandHistory, reset historyIndex.
      - Call processCommand(input) to get {type, content}.
      - If type is 'clear': set history=[] and showWelcome=false.
      - Else if type is 'banner': set showWelcome=true.
      - Else: push a new entry into history with isTyping=true to trigger TypingText.
      - Clear currentInput.
    • If ArrowUp:
      - Move up through commandHistory and set currentInput accordingly.
    • If ArrowDown:
      - Move down through commandHistory; when reaching past newest, reset to empty.
    • If Tab: preventDefault (placeholder for future autocomplete).
    • If Ctrl+L: clear history and hide welcome (like terminal “clear”).

  - handleClickAnywhere(): focus input when you click background.

  Small components inside Terminal:
  - HelpModal: Animated panel with a short description and Close button. Uses framer-motion to slide in.
  - ASCIIBanner: Preformatted ASCII art and a title block.
  - BootSequence: Animated list of fake “system loading” lines.

  Render:
  - Outer container: full-screen black terminal background. Adds a faint scanline overlay.
  - Help modal appears conditionally.
  - Terminal window (rounded, glowing border).
    • Top "portfolio buttons" bar: two links to other portfolios.
    • Terminal header: colored dots and the prompt label visitor@owais-portfolio:~$
    • Terminal body (scrollable area):
      - While isBooting: show BootSequence.
      - If not booting and showWelcome: show banner + TypeAnimation that prints name and role from personalInfo.
      - history.map(...): For each past command:
          · Show a prompt line (visitor@owais:~$ command)
          · If item.isTyping is true: render TypingText with stripHtml(item.output). When TypingText finishes, it marks the last history item’s isTyping=false and sets isTyping=false.
          · Else: render the HTML output with dangerouslySetInnerHTML (this allows the colored spans and links from commandHandler.js to display correctly).
      - Input line (only when not booting): prompt + an <input> bound to currentInput with onKeyDown={handleCommand}.
        · Shows a blinking cursor when not typing, or “Processing...” label when typing.
    • Footer: small instruction and author name/role.
  - Inline <style jsx> adds custom scrollbar styling for the output area.

HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER
- You type in the input. Press Enter.
- handleCommand calls processCommand(text).
- processCommand returns an object telling what to do and the content to show.
- Terminal updates history. If the output should be animated, it sets isTyping and renders TypingText that prints one character at a time (using stripHtml to remove HTML tags so it types clean text). After typing completes, it swaps to the final HTML (so colors and links appear) and allows next command.
- Special commands:
  • clear → wipes the history and hides the welcome.
  • banner → shows the ASCII banner/welcome again.
- All display styling uses Tailwind classes defined in index.css and tailwind.config.js.

NOTES / EDGE CASES
- Some special characters in data (like quotes or dashes) may show funny symbols if system encoding is odd, but browsers usually handle it fine with UTF-8.
- App.css appears from template and may be unused; safe to remove if not referenced.
- The resume link points to a static path; ensure that file exists in public/assets if you want the download to work in production.
- Because dangerouslySetInnerHTML is used for outputs, all HTML comes from our own code (commandHandler), which is safe. Don’t inject user-submitted HTML directly.

SUMMARY OF KEY FUNCTIONS
- processCommand(input): Parses the typed command and returns { type, content } based on a switch. Uses data from portfolioData.js to build the HTML string with Tailwind classes. Some commands are “special” (clear, banner) and are handled by Terminal differently.
- TypingText({ text, speed, onComplete }): Shows text one character at a time using setInterval. Calls onComplete when done. Used to animate outputs.
- stripHtml(html): Removes HTML tags by putting the HTML into a temporary div and reading only the text. Ensures TypingText shows plain text while animating.

That’s the complete flow and logic explained in simple words.
